Hello There!
My name is Rina Karnauch and this is my Intuit internship assignment. Some points i'd like to mention:

1. I had some problems with my postman requests through my Mac due to
    unfamiliarity with the platform, so i didn't get to test my code.

2. I'd like to change my implementation into Map structured Cinema System. I could map movies into locations and then get
the information faster. Therefore my implementation which uses arrays mainly is slow, and it could be more efficent,
but time and the bugs with postman didn't allow me to make that change.

3. Also, it makes sense to add some object oriented structures into the project, meaning adding a Ticket class and
 Movie Class, since everything in my assignment is string oriented its not ideal, its a place to grow from.

Thanks for reading and i hope it made some sense.
